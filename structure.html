        <h4 class="fw-bold mb-3" style="color: #151269;">FishCRRM (NPMO, RPIU, FCU)</h4>
        <div class="text-content" style="line-height: 1.8; color: #2d3436; text-align: justify;">
          <p class="mb-3">
            The NPMO will be established and located at the BFAR CO and headed by the BFAR Director. Three support units will be formed under NPMO, with each unit to be headed by an Assistant Director. The first unit will be for FishCRRM, the second for MARLIN, and the third for SuPrIM.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            At the FishCoRe operations level in FMAs 6 and 9, an RPIU will be formed in the Lead BFAR Region and manned by organic BFAR personnel and hired specialists as well to support its operations. An FCU will be established in participating regions in the FMA, which will also be staffed by organic BFAR personnel and hired specialists to support regional project operations in the respective FMAs.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            At the NPMO-FishCRRM, the overall responsibility for Component 1 implementation will rest with the Office of the Assistant Director for Research, Regulation and International Engagement (ADRRIE) and supported by BFAR's Capture Fisheries Division (CFD) as Component Lead, the Inland Fisheries and Aquaculture Division (IFAD), and the Fisheries Resources and Management Division (FRMD) (see Figure 7 and Annex 2). Other BFAR divisions, which will also support FishCRRM activities include: Fisheries Protection Law Enforcement Group (FPLEG), Vessel Operations Center (VOC), Fisheries Postharvest and Technology Division (FPHTD), Fisheries Inspection and Quarantine Division (FIQD), Fisheries Planning and Economic Division (FPED), Fisheries Information and Management System (FIMS), Fisheries Regulatory and Licensing Division (FRLD), and the Information and Fisherfolk Coordination Unit (IFCU). NFRDI and some specialists may be engaged by NPMO to provide technical expertise and advice in the areas of fisheries stock assessment and management, ESS, training and extension, M&E, and knowledge management.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            At the RPIU and FCU level, the Fisheries Management, Regulatory and Enforcement Division (FMRED), will provide the technical and coordination support for FishCRRM Component implementation with designated staff and the NSAP Team at the BFAR RFOs. The FMRED will be complemented by the technical staff from the following FMA Lead Region Divisions: Regional Fisheries Training and Fisherfolk Coordination Division (RFTFCD), Fisheries Production and Support Services Division (FPSSD), Regional Ad Hoc Offices on Planning and M&E as well as Administrative Office. To strengthen NSAP, the MB will be encouraged to formulate policies for BFAR RFOs to hire permanent personnel and to request DA-BFAR and concerned national agencies for regular positions for NSAP enumerators who are presently on job order status.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            The participating regions in the FMA will designate their respective FMA Coordinating Unit (FCU) FishCRRM Coordinators under the FMRED that will take the lead in synchronizing and managing the overall implementation of the FishCRRM Component activities within their respective regions. These units will also be supported by specialists to be engaged by the project to provide technical advice and share best practices that may be adopted in project implementation. Figure 1 shows the proposed FishCRRM implementation structure at the NPMO, RPIU, and FCU levels.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-0">
            In addition, the NPMO and RPIU ESS specialists, will monitor the application of the ESS's environmental and social assessment (ESA), Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and environmental and social commitment plan (ESCP) compliance on the FMA Framework, FMP, ADMP and CHRPP planning and implementation, as well as in the development and implementation of livelihood diversification and coastal habitat rehabilitation interventions with fisherfolk and LGUs.
